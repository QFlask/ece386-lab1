## Writeup

*Discuss...*

What strategies did you use to ensure that your client and server where communicating with the same schema?

In regard to preprocesing your digit images, how well do you think your server would scale to *any* picture of a digit?

Does the client/server architecture make sense for this problem? Why or why not?
